# Recent Deep Learning papers in NLU and RL

I think that other people notes are rarely useful, so I'm listing the interesting for me papers with a few words about the main idea for me to make references in memory.

If you're in such stuff, welcome: [papers' list](./PAPERS2017.md).

I've decided to keep list size feasible, so I've created a new list for 2017. The old one could be accessed [here](./PAPERS.md). I should mention, that I'm updating it from time to time, when I found an "old" interesting paper.

Also I've found that, there are some additional materials which are helpful for me or my students, so I've added a new list of miscellaneous [articles](./MISC.md).

## Table of Contents
I'm using [toc maker](https://github.com/ekalinin/github-markdown-toc.go) from Eugeny Kalinin, it is very useful, thank to him for this tool.

## Twitter integration
For twitting I'm using the perfect ["t"](https://github.com/sferik/t). It is really elegant and simple to use.
