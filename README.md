# Recent Deep Learning papers in NLU and RL

I think that other people's notes are rarely useful, so I'm listing the interesting for me papers with a few words about the main idea for me to make references in memory.

If you're in such stuff, welcome: [__papers list__](./PAPERS2018.md).

To keep list size feasible the each year papers are separated to specific file:
* [2018](./PAPERS2018.md)
* [2017](./PAPERS2017.md)
* [2016 & earlier](./PAPERS.md)

I'm not only adding recent papers, but also update lists for previous periods, if I find interesting "old" paper. To keep up with updates, you could follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/madrugad0).

Also I've found that, there are some additional materials which are helpful for me or my students, so I've added a new list of miscellaneous [articles](./MISC.md). It is not sorted in chronological order, only by content type.
